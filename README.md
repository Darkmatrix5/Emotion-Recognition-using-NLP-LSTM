# Emotion-Recognition-using-NLP-Deep-Learning-LSTM

This project is a simple and interactive emotion recognition system that understands how a person is feeling based on the text they write. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and an LSTM deep learning model, the app analyzes sentences and predicts emotions such as Joy, Fear, Anger, Love, Sadness, and Surprise.

The text is cleaned and processed before being passed to the model, which has been trained to capture patterns in language and emotional expressions. The model is deployed using Streamlit, making it easy for users to type in any sentence and instantly see the predicted emotion along with a confidence score.

This project is built to demonstrate how deep learning can be applied to real-world text data in a practical and user-friendly way.

Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NLP, LSTM, Streamlit
